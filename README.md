**What is RNN**
  - Unlike feedforward neural network, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) sequentially connects nodes 

**LSTM**
 - LSTM model, unlike the simple RNN, consists of various gates with different functionality. The following is an image of LSTM model:

 - The first gate located on the bottom left is “forget” gate which decides if the info from the previous node is necessary to keep or “forget”. The second gate in the middle of the node is “input” gate which decides if the info from theprevious node should be stored. At the top of the diagram is the cell state which smoothly passes the info forward and back during training.
