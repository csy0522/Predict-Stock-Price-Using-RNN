# Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts Apple's stock price by using Recurrent Neural Netowrk (RNN) + Long Shrot Term Memory (LSTM).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

# Using-RNN-to-predict-the-future-stock-price-of-Apple
**What is RNN**
  - Unlike feedforward neural network, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) sequentially connects nodes 

**LSTM**
 - LSTM model, unlike the simple RNN, consists of various gates with different functionality. The following is an image of LSTM model:

 - The first gate located on the bottom left is “forget” gate which decides if the info from the previous node is necessary to keep or “forget”. The second gate in the middle of the node is “input” gate which decides if the info from theprevious node should be stored. At the top of the diagram is the cell state which smoothly passes the info forward and back during training.
