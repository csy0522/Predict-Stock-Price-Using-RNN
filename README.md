# Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts Apple's stock price by using Recurrent Neural Netowrk (RNN) + Long Shrot Term Memory (LSTM).

## Getting Started

Use any python IDE to open the project. I personally use Spyder from Anaconda.You can download both Anaconda or Spyder from the following links:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - The Data Science Platform for Python/R
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - The Scientific Python Development Environment

### Installation

Before running the program, type the following command to install the libraries that the project depends on

```
pip install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow
```
Or simply type the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

The description of each function is located on top of them. Please read them before running for clarity.

To run the test, go to main.py, and run (Press F5 for most of the IDEs)

### Break down into end to end tests ----------------- To Be Continued...

Explain what these tests test and why

## Deployment

Download stock price charts of any companies or firms from online and insert it to the model to test its accuracy & efficiency.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The Programming Language
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The end-to-end open source machine learning platform

# Using-RNN-to-predict-the-future-stock-price-of-Apple
**What is RNN**
  - Unlike feedforward neural network, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) sequentially connects nodes 

**LSTM**
 - LSTM model, unlike the simple RNN, consists of various gates with different functionality. The following is an image of LSTM model:

 - The first gate located on the bottom left is “forget” gate which decides if the info from the previous node is necessary to keep or “forget”. The second gate in the middle of the node is “input” gate which decides if the info from theprevious node should be stored. At the top of the diagram is the cell state which smoothly passes the info forward and back during training.
